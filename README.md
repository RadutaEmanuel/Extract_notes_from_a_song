# Extract_notes_from_a_song
Extract the notes from a song using TAPDS methods.
In order to check if the extracted notes are correct the project generates an MXL file that can be uploaded on sound slice and be listened to.
The project uses four methods to obtain the notes, as a sample I uploaded mono.wav (the initial song) and PSD.wav (the song obtained form the notes extracted by periodgram method)
